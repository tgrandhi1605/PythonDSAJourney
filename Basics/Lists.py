# A list in Python is collection of items
# 	Ordered (items have a defined order, and that order doesn’t change unless you do it)
# 	Mutable (you can change, add, remove items after creating it)
# 	Can hold different data types (integers, strings, floats, even other lists)
# 	Allows duplicate values
#   Lists are defined by having values between square brackets [ ]
#   Lists can be created using the list() constructor
#   Lists can be accessed using indexing and slicing
#   Lists support various methods for adding, removing, and manipulating items
#   Lists can be iterated over using loops
#   Lists can be nested (lists within lists)
